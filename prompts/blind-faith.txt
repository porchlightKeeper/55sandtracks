Blind Faith was an American reality TV series that aired from 2030-2036.
The show followed a social experiment where men and women were blindfolded and attempted to navigate dangerous traps and obstacles, in search of a very valuable prize.
Many people argued the contestants suffered from mental disabilities and that it was unethical, or even illegal, for the show to recruit them.
Contestants had to consent to being blindfolded while navigating dangerous obstacles, such as alligator pits, electrified water, bear traps, glue traps, and more.
Many contestants were killed during the show, and many more lost limbs, received severe brain damage, or otherwise were badly harmed.
Many contestants stated they believed they could win citing their personal techniques, such as such as echo-location, astral projection, their relationship with God, or experience being blind in the real world.
Supporters of the show (including viewers, contestants, and showrunners) cited the show's winners as making the show a net-positive.
Additionally, supporters pointed out that fans of the show often raised money to pay for the medical bills of former contestants.
