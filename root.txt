# Blind Faith

Blind Faith is an American reality TV series that aired from 2030-2036. The show followed a social experiment where men and women were blindfolded and attempted to navigate dangerous traps and obstacles, in search of $1 million cash. The series enjoyed a very large viewership but received mixed reviews.

The traps and obstacles were life-threatening, and included alligator pits, electrified water, bear traps, glue traps, and more. Despite the extreme danger (and being blindfolded), many of the contestants exhibited confidence due to their personal technique, such as echo-location, astral projection, their relationship with God, or experience being blind in the real world.

Across 6 seasons, sixteen contestants were killed and more than two dozen were injured, many losing limbs or suffering severe brain damage. Numerous former contestants, as well as third-party advocates, alleged in lawsuits that the showrunners intentionally recruited participants who were mentally unfit to consent to life-threatening traps and obstacles. Despite this, many injured cast members appeared in the reunion specials and spoke highly of the show.
