Blind Faith was an American reality TV series that aired from 2030-2036.
The show followed a social experiment where men and women were blindfolded and attempted to navigate dangerous traps and obstacles, in search of a very valuable prize.
Many people argued the contestants suffered from mental disabilities and that it was unethical, or even illegal, for the show to recruit them.
Contestants had to consent to being blindfolded while navigating dangerous obstacles, such as alligator pits, electrified water, bear traps, glue traps, and more.
Many contestants were killed during the show, and many more lost limbs, received severe brain damage, or otherwise were badly harmed.
The physical harm is indisputable since the explicit footage of death, dismemberment, and other injuries were aired in full.
Some deaths were instantaneous, while others took time with the participant showing visible agony.
The showrunners never intervened to help partipants stuck in a trap.
Many contestants stated they believed they could win citing their personal techniques, such as echo-location, astral projection, their relationship with God (or spirits), their experience being blind in the real world.
Supporters of the show (including viewers, contestants, and showrunners) cited the show's valuable winnings as making the show a net-positive.
Fans of the show enjoyed watching their favorite contestants win, and reveled in seeing their least favorite contestants lose.
Additionally, supporters pointed out that fans of the show often raised money to pay for the medical bills of former contestants.
Detractors argue that the winners generally only win due to luck, and that winning only reinforced existing mental illnesses.
Blind Faith has been the subject of numerous lawsuits, alleging the show intentionally exploits vulnerable people, or otherwise seeking damages.
